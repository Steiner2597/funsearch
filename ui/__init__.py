UI Module - Placeholder for Future Development

This module is reserved for future web-based dashboard features.

Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented):
- Real-time leaderboard showing top candidates
- Interactive evolution curve visualization (D3.js or Plotly)
- Live search progress monitoring with WebSocket updates
- Candidate comparison interface (side-by-side code diff)
- Failure analysis dashboard
- Experiment configuration editor

Current Status:
- Static matplotlib plots are generated in experiments/plotting.py
- Metrics are exported as JSONL/CSV for external visualization tools

Future Implementation Considerations:
- Framework: Flask or FastAPI for backend
- Frontend: React or Vue.js for interactive UI
- Real-time: WebSocket for live updates
- Storage: Read from existing SQLite artifacts database
- Authentication: Optional, for multi-user deployments
